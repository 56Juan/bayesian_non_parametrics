# bayesian_non_parametrics
This repository contains the development of my thesis on Bayesian nonparametric models applied to functional time series. It includes theoretical foundations, computational implementations, and Bayesian inference methods. The repository is designed as a modular and extensible platform for future research and model extensions.
